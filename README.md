<h1 align="center"> Workshop on Experimental Design & Data Analysis </h1>

<h3> This workshop serves as a guide of the basics of experimental design and data analysis covering the following topics:</h3>


* Data types
* Experimental Design
* Linear Regression
* Multilevel Modeling

<h3> Experimental Design</h3>
Provides foundational explanation on concepts such as:

* Variable types
* Couterbalancing
* Randomizaton

<h3> Data Analysis </h3>
Provides in=depth explanations of the foundations of:

* Linear Regression
* Multilevel Modeling (aka Mixed Effects Modeling)

<br>
<i> Note: the materials in this workshop were originally developed for Linguists and many examples hail from this research area. While many aspects of experimental design and data analysis covered here are applicable to a wide range of scientific fields, do bear in mind thaty some concepts are discipline-specific.<i>
